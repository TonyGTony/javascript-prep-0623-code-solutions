## Notes

The var keyword is used to declare a variable with function scope or global scope. However, it has some quirks and is generally recommended to use let and const instead.
The let keyword is used to declare a block-scoped variable, which means it is limited to the block in which it is defined (such as within a function, loop, or conditional statement).
The const keyword is used to declare a block-scoped constant variable, which cannot be reassigned after it is defined. It provides immutability to the variable.
